Lucid
=====

Lucid is a minimalist blogging platformed inspired by Medium and Svbtle. It is written in Go and uses the Gorilla toolkit.

To run you must edit the config/config.properties to include the server you are running from and the email properties for sending forgotten password emails.

Everything else is standard Go.  A go install will create the “lucid” executable which will start the web server and host the blog.
